# DSA Learning Project

This repository contains my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning materials and practice problems for my software development course. It is organized by **weekly topics** following my syllabus, making it easy to track progress and revise for quizzes, assignments, or interviews.

## 📖 About Each Week

- **Week 1:** Course orientation, introduction to DSA and Java basics.  
- **Week 2:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), class hierarchies, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- **Weeks 3-4:** List and Collection Framework (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap).  
- **Week 5:** Testing and debugging techniques.  
- **Week 6:** Reading week — review previous modules and assignments.  
- **Weeks 7-8:** Stacks and Queues, implementation and common applications.  
- **Week 9:** Recursion, common problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and backtracking basics.  
- **Week 10:** Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Traversals).  
- **Weeks 11-12:** Sets and Maps, advanced usage of HashSet and HashMap.  
- **Weeks 13-14:** Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort).  
- **Week 15:** Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra).
